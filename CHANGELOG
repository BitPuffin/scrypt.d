0.1.0

PLANNED: remove the sha1 digest of the password hash.
PLANNED: also return work factors in the string.

0.0.9

Works! But don't use this version
It makes a sha1 digest which opens up the possibility
that there will be hash collisions. Also it doesn't
return the work factor which you should store.
